        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I'm a Salesforce Commerce Cloud Developer and Architect based in Brooklyn, NY currently employed at Diane von Furstenberg. My specialities are finding and implementing solutions for businesses and mentoring other developers. I graduated from the University of Texas at Dallas with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Arts and Technology and a focus on web design and development. <a href="about.html" alt="Learn more about Clarissa" title="Learn more about Clarissa">Learn more!</a></p>
        <h2>Why do I do it?</h2>
        <p>Building a solid codebase and solving problems gets me hype. When I propose and develop solutions, I always have two things in mind: flexibilty and longevity. I strongly believe in building things to last and never sacrificing quality.</p>
